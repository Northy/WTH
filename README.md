# Warframe Trade Helper

Warframe Trade Helper is an mini spam bot that will help you in your trades in warframe, removing the need to keep typing the sell or buy status in the trade chat, and letting you go AFK while waiting for the platinum.

The project is python based, and is open-source, so feel free to modify the code to your will.
The modules used are:
 - sys
 - pip
 - subprocess
 - time
 - random
 - threading
 - pyautogui
 - keyboard
 - sched
 
The software should download the modules by itself, but in case of errors, rename the extension to ".py" and check any anomaly.
Hope the software helps someone.
